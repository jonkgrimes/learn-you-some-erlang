jonkgrimes's learn-you-some-erlang travails
===========================================

Just my perusal of the awesome [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com) book.

I usually like to track my progress with these so I have something to refer back to when I start using the language for reals.

Btw, if you're just some rando reading this and are interested in Erlang, I highly recommend this [book](http://learnyousomeerlang.com).
 
It's acutally some of the most fun reading a programming book in a long while.
