My Learn You Some Erlang Travails
===========================================

Just my perusal of the awesome [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com) book.

I usually like to track my progress with these so I have something to refer back to when I start using the language for reals.

Btw, if you're just some rando reading this and are interested in Erlang, I highly recommend this [book](http://learnyousomeerlang.com).
 
It's acutally some of the most fun reading a programming book I've had in a long while. I initially came upon it through the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) website (which also recommended it).
